SNPPy (requires Python 2.7)

usage:
-f [FILENAME]
-i init
-u update
-r report

examples:

Create a snppy db:
snppy -f sample.db -i

Update SNPs from SNPedia:
snppy -f sample.db -u

Generate a report about 23andme data from SNPedia data:
snppy -f sample.db -r

SNPPy requires genetic data from 23andme.com. 
There is a small sample included in this repository, and there are all also freely available datasets available online.

SNPPy populates a database from the MediaWiki API of snpedia.org

The authors of this software are in no way affiliated with snpedia.org or the SNPedia project.  It is the intention of the
authors of this software to eventually include a smaller version of the SNPedia SNP database alongside this project.
Until then, be advised that the database created by create_dbs.py in this repository fall under the
